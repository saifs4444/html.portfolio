<h1>Voiceover</h1>
<p>
    Voiceover refers to the technique of recording and integrating spoken narration or dialogue into a video, film, or multimedia production. It involves a voice artist or actor delivering a script or dialogue while watching the visual content. The recorded voiceover is then synchronized with the video during the editing process to create a cohesive and engaging final product.
